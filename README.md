I made this landing page for a nursery (pre-school). I used HTML for the structure of the content on the page. Then, I styled the page with CSS. I mainly used flexbox and relative units (rem) to make the layout responsive. 

I made the page responsive using media queries for most common devices i.e smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, etc. I used Javascript for the responsive hamburger menu for mobile screens. 

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I will use bootstrap to make responsive, mobile first page.  

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt that it's easier to design the header with flexbox and then use Javascript for the hamburger toggle function.
